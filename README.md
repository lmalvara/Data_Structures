# Data_Structures
Projects I made in my Data Structures class

you can compile the programs using the command bellow:
Hw0: g++ -std=c++11 count.cpp -o count (counts how many words and numbers there are in .txt file)
Hw1: g++ -std=c++11 infinitearithmetic.cpp (introduction to pointers and doubly linked list to create +/- calculator incomplete)
HW2: g++ -std=c++11 Source.cpp -o sort (sorting algorithm for large .txt files from smallest to greatest)
Hw3: g++ -std=c++11 infinitearithmetic.cpp -o infinitearithmetic (expanded on Hw1 for * and /)
Hw4: g++ -std=c++11 Source.cpp -o traversal (basic code practicing tree traversal)
Hw5: g++ -std=c++11 Source.cpp (in order, post order, and pre order)
